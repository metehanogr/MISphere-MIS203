      <p class="page-subtitle readable-text">
        MISphere is a small, text-focused website designed to give Management
        Information Systems students a single place to follow updates, see
        events and explore a simple community structure.

          <h2>What is MISphere?</h2>
          <p class="readable-text">
            MISphere is a compact “department hub” concept for MIS students. It
            does not try to be a full portal or a real learning management
            system; instead, it shows how information can be organised in a
            clear, structured way using only basic web technologies.
          </p>
          <ul class="profile-list">
            <li>Central place to see recent updates and announcements.</li>
            <li>Simple list of MIS-related events and activities.</li>
            <li>
              A minimal forum layout where students could discuss courses,
              group work and study ideas.
            </li>
            <li>
              A static student profile that demonstrates how academic
              information can be presented.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p class="readable-text">
            The main audience is current and prospective MIS students, as well
            as instructors who want to see a clean example of an organised,
            text-based website.

          <h2>Page Structure</h2>
          <p class="readable-text">
            The website is organised into a small set of pages that each have a
            clear role:
          </p>
          <ul class="profile-list">
            <li>
              <strong>Home:</strong> welcome message and the most recent
              updates.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Events:</strong> table of upcoming and past MIS-related
              activities.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Forum:</strong> example threads and a demo “new topic”
              form.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Login / Profile:</strong> a demo login &amp; sign-up
              layout that fills a sample student profile.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p class="readable-text">
            All pages use the same header, navigation bar and footer to keep
            the experience consistent.
          </p>
        </aside>
      </div>

      <section class="section">
        <h2>Design Choices</h2>
        <p class="readable-text">
          MISphere intentionally uses a calm, text-first design instead of
          heavy images or complex components. The goal is to make information
          easy to scan and to look like a small departmental website rather
          than a generic blog template.
        </p>
        <ul class="profile-list">
          <li>
            A blue background and simple cards to separate content blocks
            visually.
          </li>
          <li>
            Serif headings together with slightly larger body text for
            readability.
          </li>
          <li>
            Repeated layout patterns: header, navigation, main content area and
            footer are the same on every page.
          </li>
          <li>
            Limited use of interactive elements; JavaScript is kept to a few
            small features such as the demo login and dynamic year in the
            footer.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How to Read This Website</h2>
        <p class="readable-text">
          This website can be read from top to bottom as a simple journey:
          first understanding what MISphere is, then seeing events, example
          discussions and finally a student profile that shows how information
          about MIS studies can be summarised.
        </p>
        <p class="readable-text">
          While no real accounts, data or back-end systems are used, MISphere
          demonstrates how Management Information Systems ideas such as
          structured information, user-oriented design and clear navigation can
          already be applied with a basic web stack.
